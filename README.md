# Medical-Diagnosis-Risk-Scoring-using-Bayesian-Networks
Course work Project: Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning

This repository contains 5 Colab notebook files each defined by its name and the commit message.

I have implemented Bayesian Network for medical diagnosis particularly Heart disease and Diabetes as my core problem. Heart Disease dataset contains multiple classes so I have dealt it as both binary and multi class problem.

To execute these files, simply clone them and execute them on Jupyter or Colab IDE.
